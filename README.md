```md
[**@your username**](the URL to your profile) something about you
```

For example, this is what I did with mine:

> [**@gvegayon**](https://github.com/gvegayon) My first programming language was Visual Basic and before going to business school I wanted to be a musician <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/893619?s=460&u=723af9d8b02e277a5a91e0c179bbdf4450abec4b&v=4" alt="An old picture of me" width="40px">

Notice the figure of my username (that's optional and fun). This is the code I used of writing that line:
